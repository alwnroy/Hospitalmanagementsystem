# Hospital-management-system

A website was created for a hospital, enabling doctors to log in and efficiently manage their patient records. Doctors can register themselves, with their information being stored in a MySQL database. After logging in, doctors can access their patient dashboard, where they can view their schedule, as well as add, edit, or delete patient records with ease.
